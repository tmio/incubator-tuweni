# Module tuweni

Tuweni is a set of libraries and other tools to aid development of blockchain and other decentralized software in Java and other JVM languages. It includes a low-level bytes library, serialization and deserialization codecs (e.g. RLP), various cryptography functions and primitives, and lots of other helpful utilities.

# Gossip application

This application creates a sample standalone application applying the Plumtree gossip library.

```bash
$>bin/gossip --help
 Usage: <main class> [-h] [--sending] [--numberOfMessages=<numberOfMessages>]
                     [--payloadSize=<payloadSize>]
                     [--sendInterval=<sendInterval>] [-c=<configPath>]
                     [-l=<port>] [-m=<messageLog>] [-n=<networkInterface>]
                     [-r=<rpcPort>] [-p[=<peers>...]]...
       --numberOfMessages=<numberOfMessages>
                             Number of messages to publish (load testing)
       --payloadSize=<payloadSize>
                             Size of the random payload to send to other peers (load
                               testing)
       --sending             Whether this peer sends random messages to all other
                               peers (load testing)
       --sendInterval=<sendInterval>
                             Interval to wait in between sending messages in
                               milliseconds (load testing)
   -c, --config=<configPath> Configuration file.
   -h, --help                Prints usage prompt
   -l, --listen=<port>       Port to listen on
   -m, --messageLog=<messageLog>
                             Log file where messages are stored
   -n, --networkInterface=<networkInterface>
                             Network interface to bind to
   -p, --peer[=<peers>...]   Static peers list
   -r, --rpc=<rpcPort>       RPC port to listen on
```

Example usage:
```bash
$>bin/gossip --sending --payloadSize 512 --sendInterval 200 -l 2000 -r 4000 -n 0.0.0.0 -p tcp://127.0.0.1:3000 -p tcp://127.0.0.1:3001
```

You can configure this application to send random messages to other peers.
The application can also open up a RPC port accepting messages to propagate:

```bash
$>curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/publish -d "hello"
```

The application optionally takes a config file (with the `-c` flag).

Default configuration:
```toml
listenPort = 0
rpcPort = 0
networkInterface = "0.0.0.0"
peers = []
messagelog = "messages.log"
sending = false
sendInterval = 1000
numberOfMessages=100
payloadSize = 200
```

Sample sender configuration:
```toml
listenPort = 2000
rpcPort = 4000
networkInterface = "0.0.0.0"
peers = [ "tcp://127.0.0.1:3000", "tcp://127.0.0.1:3001"]
messagelog = "messages.log"
sending = true
sendInterval = 1000
numberOfMessages=100
payloadSize = 200
```

Peers are encoded as URIs using the TCP scheme: `tcp://127.0.0.1:3000`

# Relayer application

This application relays two hobbits endpoints.

Usage:
```bash
$> bin/hobbits-relayer --help
Usage: <main class> [-h] [-b=<bind>] [-t=<to>]
  -b, --bind=<bind>   Endpoint to bind to
  -h, --help          Prints usage prompt
  -t, --to=<to>       Endpoint to relay to
```

The application prints out messages to STDOUT.

Sample use:

Listen to a port
```bash
$> netcat -l -p 18000
```

Set up the relayer:
```bash
$> bin/hobbits-relayer -b tcp://localhost:10000 -t tcp://localhost:18000
```

Send a message:
```bash
$> cat message 
EWP 0.2 RPC 5 5
hellohello
$> cat message | netcat localhost 10000
```

The relayer will show the message:
```bash
EWP 0.2 RPC 5 5
0x68656C6C6F
0x68656C6C6F
```

The listener will show the message, received:
```bash
$> netcat -l -p 18000
EWP 0.2 RPC 5 5
hellohello
```
