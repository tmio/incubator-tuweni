# Ethereum client application

| Status         |               |
|----------------|---------------|
| Stability      | [prototype]   |
| Component Type | [application] |

The `tuweni` application is an Ethereum client that can run multiple chains and multiple discovery mechanisms.

`tuweni` can sync multiple chains at once. It also has a web UI.

NOTE: everything at this point is at best a prototype. This may change at any time.

Usage:

```bash
Apache Tuweni client loading
Usage: <main class> [-h] [-c=<configPath>] [-w=<web>]
-c, --config=<configPath>
Configuration file.
-h, --help        Prints usage prompt
-w, --web=<web>   Web console host:port
```

Most of the action happens in the configuration file, written with TOML.

Example with one chain:

```toml
[storage.default]
path="data"
genesis="default"
[genesis.default]
path=default.json
```

The `default.json` file is your usual genesis configuration file.

Example with two chains:

Example with one chain:

```toml
[storage.foo]
path="data"
genesis="foo"
[genesis.foo]
path=default.json
[storage.bar]
path="data"
genesis="bar"
[genesis.bar]
path=other.json
```
