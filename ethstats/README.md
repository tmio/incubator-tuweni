# EthStats server

| Status         |           |
|----------------|-----------|
| Stability      | [alpha]   |
| Component Type | [library] |

This library defines [`EthStatsServer`](https://tuweni.apache.org/docs/org.apache.tuweni.ethstats/-eth-stats-server/index.html),
a server implementing the EthStats protocol. Over a websocket connection, Ethereum clients can connect and send information
to this server.

The server accepts a [EthStatsServerController](https://tuweni.apache.org/docs/org.apache.tuweni.ethstats/-eth-stats-server-controller/index.html) which will receive all the information from clients.

You will need to implement your own controller. There is a controller for OpenTelemetry provided as example in this library, `OpenTelemetryServerController`.
