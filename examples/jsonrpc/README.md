# JSON-RPC proxy

The JSON-RPC proxy allows you to cache requests to a JSON-RPC endpoint.

This example showcases how to use the proxy with a public service.

## Requirements

This example requires Docker, Docker Compose 1.25, Java 11 and Gradle > 6.

## Steps

### Check out this repository

`$> git clone https://github.com/tmio/tuweni`

### Build the image

You need to install the Gradle wrapper the first time you make a checkout:

`$> gradle setup`

You can now run gradle to build the docker image:

`$> ./gradlew dist::buildBinImage`

The build should end with similar lines:
```bash
 ---> be57b46c612c
Successfully built be57b46c612c
Successfully tagged tuweni/tuweni:2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
Created image with ID 'be57b46c612c'.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 13s
256 actionable tasks: 2 executed, 254 up-to-date
```

### Run the example

Make sure the image you just tagged matches the one in the `docker_compose.yml` file.

Run Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
