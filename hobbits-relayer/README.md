# Hobbits Relayer


| Status         |           |
|----------------|-----------|
| Stability      | [beta]    |
| Component Type | [example] |

The `hobbits-relayer` application showcases how to use the Hobbits protocol to pass messages between different networks.

```bash
hobbits-relayer --help
Usage: <main class> [-h] [-b=<bind>] [-t=<to>]
-b, --bind=<bind>   Endpoint to bind to
-h, --help          Prints usage prompt
-t, --to=<to>       Endpoint to relay to
```

Example use:

Relay messages over TCP from port 21000 to 22000:
```bash
hobbits-relayer -b tcp://localhost:21000 -t tcp://localhost:22000
```

Relay messages over UDP from port 2222 to 4444:
```bash
hobbits-relayer -b udp://localhost:2222 -t udp://localhost:4444
```

Relay messages from a Web Socket port 2222 to a TCP server on 4444:
```bash
hobbits-relayer -b ws://localhost:2222 -t tcp://localhost:4444
```
