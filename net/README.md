# Net

|----------------|-----------|
| Stability      | [stable]  |
| Component Type | [library] |

# Getting started

To get started, install the `net` library.

With Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>org.apache.tuweni</groupId>
<artifactId>net</artifactId>
<version>{{site.data.project.latest_release}}</version>
</dependency>
```

Or using Gradle:

```groovy
implementation("org.apache.tuweni:net:{{site.data.project.latest_release}}")
```

If you haven't already, you will also need to add Bouncy Castle to your dependencies, and add the Bouncy Castle Security Provider to Java.

```java
Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
```

# Permissions

Since we're engaging in peer-to-peer applications, we will define different scenarios for trust.

First off, we will engage in two-way certificate authentication. The server will provide its certificate to the client and the client will also need to provide its identity.

All those settings are taken after the [Constellation private enclave network options](https://github.com/consensys/constellation).

## CA
By default, Java uses Certificate Authorities on the machine to authenticate a trusted certificate.

## Recording
We can also choose to record the fingerprints of incoming connections while authorizing all of them.

## Trust On First Use (TOFU)
In this setting, incoming connections are recorded, and their certificates are collected, but only the first certificate assigned to a connection is allowed.

This is a good way to mitigate MITM attacks.

## Allowlist

Only explicit hosts and certificate combinations are allowed.

# TrustManagerFactories

[`TrustManagerFactory` implementations](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/TrustManagerFactory.html) provide trust with JDK and most Java-based servers.

The [`TrustManagerFactories` API](/docs/org.apache.tuweni.net.tls/-trust-manager-factories/index.html) creates `TrustManagerFactory` objects for client and server communications.

As an example, the following method creates a `TrustManagerFactory` that records incoming connections into a `knownServersFile`, but only the ones that don't have a signed CA certificate.

```java
TrustManagerFactories.recordServerFingerprints(knownServersFile, false);
```

# VertxTrustOptions

The [`VertxTrustOptions` API](/docs/org.apache.tuweni.net.tls/-vertx-trust-options/index.html) is a quick drop-in API to configure Vert.x servers and clients for communications.

In the example below, we set a server to require client authentication and trust clients on first access (TOFU).
```java
HttpServerOptions options = new HttpServerOptions();
options.setSsl(true)
.setClientAuth(ClientAuth.REQUIRED)
.setPemKeyCertOptions(serverCert.keyCertOptions())
.setTrustOptions(VertxTrustOptions.trustClientOnFirstAccess(knownClientsFile))
.setIdleTimeout(1500)
.setReuseAddress(true)
.setReusePort(true);
httpServer = vertx.createHttpServer(options);
```

In this example, we set a HTTP client to communicate with servers that are whitelisted only (and not even trust CA-signed certificates):
```java
HttpClientOptions options = new HttpClientOptions();
options.setSsl(true)
.setTrustOptions(VertxTrustOptions.whitelistServers(knownServersFile, false))
.setConnectTimeout(1500)
.setReuseAddress(true)
.setReusePort(true);
client = vertx.createHttpClient(options);
```
