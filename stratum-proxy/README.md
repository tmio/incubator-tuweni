# Stratum Proxy

| Status         |               |
|----------------|---------------|
| Stability      | [beta]        |
| Component Type | [application] |

This application acts as a proxy between an Ethereum client and miners.

It connects to the client over JSON-RPC (using http://localhost:8545), polling for new work periodically, and submitting work sent by clients.

It runs a [Stratum server](https://tuweni.apache.org/docs/org.apache.tuweni.stratum.server/-stratum-server/index.html) to which miners can connect to over Stratum.

Usage:
* Expose a Stratum server on 0.0.0.0:16000:
```bash
$> stratum-proxy 16000
```
