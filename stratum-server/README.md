# Stratum Server

| Status         |           |
|----------------|-----------|
| Stability      | [beta]    |
| Component Type | [library] |

This library introduces a [Stratum server](https://tuweni.apache.org/docs/org.apache.tuweni.stratum.server/-stratum-server/index.html) which listens on a TCP port for connections from stratum clients.

The server is compatible with the eth-proxy and Stratum1 protocols.

The server accepts new work with the `setNewWork(powInput: PoWInput)` method, with a parameter of type [PowInput](https://tuweni.apache.org/docs/org.apache.tuweni.stratum.server/-po-w-input/index.html).
